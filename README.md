# **Road Map**

---

### **1. LeetCode Challenges**
The number of challenges you need depends on your starting point and the areas where you need improvement. Here's a rough breakdown:
- **Beginner**: Start with **50–100 easy problems** to build confidence and understanding of basic patterns.
- **Intermediate**: Solve **150–200 medium problems** focusing on a mix of topics like dynamic programming, graphs, and greedy algorithms.
- **Advanced**: Attempt at least **50–100 hard problems** to build advanced skills and handle edge cases.

By the time you've solved **300–500 diverse problems**, you should have a solid foundation to tackle almost any coding interview.

### **2. Focus on Problem Diversity**
It's not about quantity but the variety and depth of problems:
- Cover all core topics: Arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, trees, backtracking, and more.
- Prioritize quality over quantity. Understand the problem fully before moving to the next.

### **3. Beyond LeetCode**
While LeetCode helps sharpen algorithmic thinking, top 1% programmers are strong in multiple areas:
- **System Design**: Learn to design scalable and efficient systems (study distributed systems, databases, APIs, etc.).
- **Practical Coding Skills**: Work on real-world projects to understand software development, debugging, testing, and version control.
- **Low-Level Programming**: Explore low-level concepts like memory management, OS fundamentals, or embedded systems (if relevant to your domain).
- **Open Source Contributions**: Contributing to large projects helps you understand codebases, collaboration, and advanced software practices.

---

### **4. Compete and Benchmark Yourself**
- Participate in coding contests on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef to measure your skill level.
- Aim for a high rating in competitions (e.g., a Codeforces rating of 2000+ places you in the top tier).

---

### **5. Build Intuition and Speed**
- Regularly review your solved problems to identify patterns and optimize approaches.
- Time yourself during practice to simulate real interview or competition conditions.

---

### **6. Soft Skills and Career Growth**
Top 1% programmers are not just coders:
- Develop excellent communication skills to explain solutions and work with teams.
- Learn to write clean, maintainable code and understand trade-offs in design.

---

### **Key Metrics to Track Progress**
1. **Number of Problems Solved**: Aim for **300–500+**, covering all difficulty levels.
2. **Contest Performance**: Track improvements in coding competitions.
3. **Consistency**: Solve problems regularly (5–10 a day is reasonable for intensive preparation).
4. **Learning Outcomes**: Focus on how well you can explain solutions or apply concepts in real-world scenarios.

Ultimately, while solving LeetCode problems is important, being a top 1% programmer requires a blend of theoretical knowledge, real-world experience, and consistent practice.
